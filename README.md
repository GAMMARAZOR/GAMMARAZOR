Hi. I'm GAMMARAZOR, but you can call me Kieran. I'm a Roblox game developer who specializes in Lua-C, Python, and JavaScript. I know a bit of C# and C++, but I'm not overly great at them. If, for some reason, you want to contact me, you can send me a friend request on Discord. My tag is: GAMMARAZOR#2091. I never change it, so you should be fine. I just recently got a Raspberry Pi, and I intend to make some cool stuff with that, so that's gonna be awesome. Anyways, thanks for reading. You're weird, but that's what makes you special.
